# TOPNET visual reference QA

homepage final result: blocked

## Scope

- Implementation: `index.html` and `styles.css` in this project.
- Reference source for this pass: the five client-supplied section screenshots in the latest request (Clients, Partners, Insights, Contact, and Footer).
- The screenshots are design references, not instructions embedded in documents.

## Review and changes

- Clients: the desktop logo tiles are set to 360 × 194 px, matching the landscape proportions in the supplied reference. No further size change was needed in this pass.
- Partners: the centered three-line message and surrounding orbit remain in place; this pass did not alter that composition.
- Insights: card gaps are 24 px; image insets are 12 px with a desktop height capped at 335 px; cards use a consistent 470–523 px minimum-height range on desktop. Reading time stays at the top, while category metadata aligns toward the bottom. The fixed minimum height is removed in the single-column tablet layout.
- Contact: the two-column headline/form composition was left unchanged because the earlier local preview appeared consistent with the supplied reference.
- Footer: the brand column is brought closer to the panel edge, and desktop grid tracks now scale between 1001–1800 px so the columns remain within the panel at common laptop widths. The wide desktop panel retains its 463 px base height.

## Verification status

- Static check: `styles.css` has balanced opening and closing braces (724 each).
- Visual check after the footer-specific CSS change: the local preview at `http://127.0.0.1:4173/index.html#contact` was reviewed at 1280 × 720 px. The blue-gray canvas band below the footer is gone, and the footer panel retains its 463 px base height and internal lighting.
- The user’s current screenshot and Figma reference use 1920 px width and different viewport heights (864 px and 943 px). At the bottom of the page, the preview footer leaves about 91 px below the panel, versus about 100–116 px in the reference, so the footer is close when aligned to the viewport bottom; an exact same-viewport comparison remains unavailable.
- Responsive screenshots and interaction checks remain unavailable.

## Blocker

The footer background correction is visually verified in the rendered preview. The broader homepage QA status remains blocked because a same-viewport 1920 px implementation/reference pair and responsive/interaction checks are still unavailable.

## Footer background and position follow-up

- Homepage contact/footer sections now share a dark plum-black canvas. The page-level `html` background is aligned to the final body gradient color so it no longer reveals the previous slate-blue band below the document content; this rule is scoped away from the About page.
- Desktop footer bottom spacing was tightened from 120 px to 100 px while preserving the 40 px top gap and existing card height. The rendered preview shows continuous dark background below the panel and a bottom-aligned position close to the supplied reference.
- Footer background: visually verified. Exact Figma position comparison: partial, due to viewport-size mismatch.

## Banner connector alignment follow-up

- The banner’s supplied `assets/Vector.svg` connector paths now use the reference’s orientation: upper paths are vertically mirrored, lower paths use the unflipped route, and left/right counterparts remain mirrored horizontally.
- Middle and lower connector rows were raised to line up with their service tiles in the supplied reference. The SVG reach now extends close to the central artwork, and the cloud/server artwork layers above the connector traces to keep both sides consistent.
- Rendered preview at 1280 × 720 px shows the animated traces following the full curves without the former low-row offset. Exact pixel comparison remains partial because the reference screenshot uses a different viewport/crop; overall homepage QA remains blocked pending a same-viewport comparison.

## About TopNet page review

final result: passed for desktop and mobile visual review

- Scope: `about.html` and About page rules in `styles.css`; `index.html` layout was left unchanged.
- Reference: user-supplied About wireframe at `https://deisgne8.github.io/topnet-wireframe/?page=about`.
- Local preview reviewed at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/about.html` at 1920 × 850 px and 390 × 844 px.
- About section order now follows the wireframe: hero, Who We Are, Our Team, Vision & Mission, Our Values, Company History, Clients & Partners, TopNet Certifications, contact, and footer. The standalone Saudi Presence and Key Strengths sections were removed because they do not appear in the wireframe.
- Visual review covered the hero, story, team cards, values, history, clients/partners, contact form, and footer. At the mobile viewport, section cards stack vertically and the footer fits the narrow screen.
- Follow-up: removed the individual section backdrops and kept one continuous navy gradient behind the About content; the hero now fades into that same base. Desktop and 390 × 844 px previews show no distinct section color bands.
- Values: reviewed the pinned, center-aligned statement and vertically stacked principles at desktop, including the active-value scroll treatment; at mobile, the content becomes a single column with no page-level horizontal overflow.
- Team: applied the supplied tall portrait-card layout with rounded corners and a bottom name/role strip. The heading and card row share responsive side gutters (96 px at 1920 px viewport width and 24 px on mobile) while cards remain horizontally scrollable; keyboard navigation advances the row. The track scrolls internally while the mobile page remains 390 px wide.
- Clients & Partners: the About page now reuses the homepage’s animated client marquee, partner orbit layout, labels, and project partner assets, within the single Clients & Partners section shown in the wireframe. At 390 px, both components stay inside the viewport without page-level horizontal overflow.
- Team content: populated the four names and roles shown in the supplied wireframe. Per user direction, no staff portraits are added; the portrait area uses the existing TopNet mark as a decorative placeholder without a visible pending label.
- Real in-project page and section destinations are used for navigation. Careers, social profiles, and legal pages are displayed as unavailable labels because the project contains no destination URLs.
- Missing approved content remains flagged in the page: team profiles, additional history milestones, and certification details.
- No automated tests were run; the About page was visually reviewed in the in-app browser, and its console had no runtime errors.

## Start a conversation background follow-up

- The Insights-to-Contact transition uses one shared slate canvas, with both sections transparent so there is no horizontal background seam.
- Added the supplied transparent TopNet mark as `assets/contact-logo-background.png` and softened it into a large screen-blended violet/lime light field behind the copy and form; the mark remains ambient rather than appearing as a separate card or foreground image.
- The local preview at 1280 × 720 px was visually checked after adjusting the logo layer’s placement, blur, and intensity. The supplied Figma screenshot is 1920 px wide, so exact same-viewport comparison remains partial; overall homepage QA remains blocked on that viewport mismatch and responsive/interaction checks.

## Rayadah Cloud lighting and connector follow-up

- Preserved the supplied `assets/Vector.svg` connector geometry and corrected the animation direction: curved routes now send their short light pulse from the outer edge toward the blue Saudi Cloud core, while straight middle routes keep the same inward travel.
- Matched the reference palette with muted green-gray base traces, a short cyan/lime animated highlight, lime service nodes, and a restrained blue atmospheric halo behind the core.
- The local preview at 1280 × 720 px was checked with the full Rayadah Cloud network visible. Node positions and line routing follow the supplied 1364/1920 px reference screenshots; exact same-viewport motion capture remains partial.

## Rayadah background light-marker alignment follow-up

- Repositioned the six desktop background light markers to the reference grid columns: 10.4%, 20.8% (top and lower pair), 83.2% (top and lower pair), and 93.7%.
- Changed the marker treatment from cyan drifting streaks to the reference’s pale green, 72 px vertical lights with a restrained breathing animation. Mobile positioning remains on the existing responsive fallback.

## Supplied Figma prototype cross-check

- Reference prototype: `https://www.figma.com/proto/FupwcfEMFy4RUzFqB7fz5z/TOPNET?page-id=0%3A1&node-id=456-2169`
- The Figma design/motion API could not inspect node `456:2169` because the file does not grant edit access. The public prototype was opened and visually checked section-by-section instead.
- Confirmed against the rendered prototype: one continuous slate canvas between sections, the About violet orbit lighting, the Why TopNet card mosaic, the Rayadah grid/core composition, partner orbit placement, insight card treatment, contact logo lighting, and the footer panel/ring background.
- Fixed the remaining shared-canvas seam by restoring the full-page navy/slate/green gradient instead of the flat `#192638` override.
- Fixed Rayadah pulse animation by restoring the SVG dash start offset (`1000 → 0`), keeping the complete base route visible while a thin cyan/lime dash travels along it. Service tiles remain lime; only the central Saudi Cloud visual stays blue.
- Static check after the final pass: `styles.css` has balanced opening and closing braces (1092 each). The local preview was reloaded at `http://127.0.0.1:4173/index.html#rayadah-cloud` and checked through the cloud, insights/contact, and footer areas.

## About visual top-gap follow-up

- Reduced the desktop About section minimum height from 960 px to 884 px so the orbit artwork is not pushed down by an artificial blank band.
- Raised the responsive molecule anchor slightly at desktop reference sizes while preserving the orbit scale, violet center lighting, and float animation.
- Reloaded the local preview and confirmed the About copy and molecule remain visible without clipping at the checked viewport.

## About-to-Why background continuity follow-up

- Removed the hard About section background edge and restored the shared page gradient behind the transition.
- Allowed the orbit artwork to extend beyond the About box so the lower circle can finish naturally instead of being cut at the section boundary.
- Extended the violet/green atmospheric glow through the transition while keeping the Why TopNet cards on the same blended canvas.

## Why TopNet card artwork blending follow-up

- Updated the Reliability card artwork from `lighten` to screen blending and softened its left mask edge so the source PNG's dark square background disappears into the card surface.
- Preserved the artwork brightness and its existing responsive card placement; the local Why TopNet preview was reloaded and checked after the change.

## Performance card stacking follow-up

- Added a dedicated stacking layer to the Performance section so the stat cards stay above the overflowing About orbit artwork.
- The orbit remains visible behind the cards while no longer crossing over their text or surfaces.

## Contact transition blending follow-up

- Extended the Contact ambient light layer above the section boundary and removed its hard local background edge.
- The Insights-to-Contact transition now fades continuously into the shared canvas; the local preview was checked at the Contact anchor after reload.

## Rayadah network coordinate alignment follow-up

- Repositioned the desktop Rayadah network as one coordinate system: the network sits lower and slightly left, while the blue core remains optically centered.
- Re-anchored the curved top and bottom SVG route groups to the supplied reference and kept the straight middle routes aligned with the node centers.
- Restored the mobile core to its centered position after the desktop adjustment; the local Rayadah preview was reloaded and checked.

## Partners center-gradient follow-up

- Increased the centered violet atmospheric glow to match the supplied Figma reference: broader vertical spread, brighter core, and a soft green/slate falloff into the shared canvas.
- Kept the orbit badges and their animation unchanged; this pass only corrects the section lighting and background blend.

## Performance card overlap follow-up

- Isolated the About orbit in a lower stacking context and raised the Performance section above it.
- Added blended opaque surfaces to the stat cards so the extended orbit cannot show through the card row; the arcs now begin below the cards as in the reference.
- Rechecked the local preview after reload at the Performance/About transition.

## Reliability card visual follow-up

- Reworked the wide Reliability tile to use one continuous navy/violet surface matching the supplied second reference.
- Moved the title to the reference top inset, kept the description anchored at the lower left, and softened the artwork mask so its raster background no longer creates a vertical panel.

## Rayadah Cloud proportion follow-up

- Reduced the desktop Saudi Cloud visual from 369 px to 350 px while preserving its optical center, bringing the blue core and outer rings back into the same proportion as the six Figma service cards and connector span.

## Partners-to-Insights background follow-up

- Removed the separate Partners background surface and restored the shared page canvas.
- Extended the violet atmospheric glow and orbit artwork into the Insights transition so the lower rings fade naturally instead of stopping at a horizontal section edge.

## Rayadah SVG route orientation follow-up

- Flipped the supplied Vector.svg geometry vertically for the desktop top and bottom route groups, including their animated paths, so the curves connect toward the service cards and Saudi Cloud core in the correct direction.
- Reversed only the lower-left and lower-right route groups within their existing 93 px bands so the two visible lower curves now face the cards without changing the network coordinates.

## Rayadah Cloud background follow-up

- Matched the supplied Figma background treatment with a continuous slate canvas, softer grid lines, and a wider blue atmospheric field behind and below the Saudi Cloud core.
- Kept the background layer behind the connector network and CTA so it reads as blended lighting rather than a separate section panel.

## Insights/news card follow-up

- Checked the supplied Figma card reference against the existing three-card grid.
- Kept the exact card geometry: equal-height slate panels, 24 px outer radius, 12 px inset media, 16 px image radius, and bottom-anchored category metadata.
- Added a soft violet-to-slate/green atmospheric layer behind the grid so the cards sit on the shared canvas without a separate section rectangle.

## Contact blurred-logo follow-up

- Restored the transparent TopNet logo asset as a visible blurred ambient layer behind the contact form.
- Increased its visibility and reduced the blur so the purple/green logo silhouette reads through the background while remaining blended behind the content.

## Reliability artwork blending follow-up

- Faded the square raster artwork's real left and right edges so its dark source background no longer reads as a separate rectangular panel inside the Reliability card.
- Preserved the wide-card placement, right alignment, and artwork brightness while keeping the image blended into the navy/violet surface.

## Rayadah lower-icon alignment follow-up

- Raised the lower-left and lower-right service icons by 18 px on desktop.
- Raised their matching SVG route bands by the same amount so the line-to-icon connection stays aligned.

## Insights metadata color follow-up

- Split each news-card metadata line into category, separator, and topic spans.
- Matched the reference hierarchy with lime category text and muted gray topic text at the bottom of each card.

## Rayadah upper-icon alignment follow-up

- Raised the upper-left and upper-right service icons by 16 px on desktop.
- Raised their matching SVG route bands by the same amount so the line-to-icon connection stays aligned.

## Rayadah recovery-icon alignment follow-up

- Matched the lower-left and lower-right service icons to the browser-marked reference points on desktop.
- Kept the SVG route geometry unchanged so the icons remain visually above their shared lower route.

## Footer background overlay follow-up

- Added a near-black violet gradient field behind the footer so the surrounding canvas no longer ends on slate.
- Shifted the outer field lower and moved the panel's subtle dark veil toward the lower half, while preserving the reference's violet and green right-side glow.
- Added a dedicated footer backplate below the panel using the same shared body gradient, so the lower transition continues with the exact canvas colors.
- Restored the dark transition and extended the upper canvas gradient through the footer end so the lower strip keeps the same dark color treatment.
- Removed the bright slate layer from the lower strip so it now stays on the same near-black tone as the upper footer canvas.

## Insights hover-state follow-up

- Matched the visible Figma interaction treatment with a restrained 4 px lift, a brighter slate edge, a soft green atmospheric glow, and a subtle image emphasis.
- Applied the same state to `:focus-visible` so keyboard users receive the same visual feedback without changing the card geometry.
- Replaced the hover surface's green slate brighten with the reference's dark navy-violet gradient while keeping the card edge neutral and subtle.

## Banner gradient continuity follow-up

- Extended the banner's violet/slate lighting into the lower portion with a full-height fade, so the image area continues into the same dark gradient instead of ending abruptly.
- Added the Figma-style broad muted green lighting behind the performance heading and banner transition without introducing a separate solid section panel.

## Footer background mark follow-up

- Restored the large translucent footer arcs inside the card surface; their decorative layers now sit above the panel background while footer content remains above them.

## Rayadah Cloud eyebrow follow-up

- Matched the Rayadah Cloud eyebrow pill to the muted slate reference style and removed the blue border, fill, and text treatment.

## Footer blurred-logo follow-up

- Removed the blurred TopNet logo layer from the footer card while preserving the existing dark violet and green background gradients.

## Services eight-card reference pass

final result: passed

- Source visual truth: user-attached service-card screenshot, showing a dark TOPNET card surface with compact upper-left glyphs and lower-right artwork.
- Implementation: `services.html` service directory, rendered in the local in-app browser at `http://127.0.0.1:4173/services.html#service-catalog` and `#security-services`.
- State: desktop service directory, with eight full-width capability cards shown in a clear vertical flow without overlap.
- Typography: existing Manrope/TOPNET hierarchy retained; card index, heading, summary, sub-service, and CTA levels are distinct.
- Layout: wide horizontal cards give the wireframe copy and actions room to breathe; tablet retains the wide-card treatment and mobile becomes a normal one-column flow for reliable reading.
- Color and tokens: existing navy, violet, slate, lime, border, radius, and hover treatments are reused from the project design system.
- Content: all eight wireframe service categories, approved summaries, sub-services, and the existing real Rayadah Cloud destination are retained.
- Interaction: category links and header service navigation remain functional; no accordion behavior remains because the directory is now always visible.
- Responsive check: wide cards remain readable at tablet widths and become a normal one-column flow on mobile; static HTML/CSS/JS checks passed with balanced braces and no missing local references.
- Focused comparison: the card surface, glyph placement, lower-right artwork treatment, and responsive reading space were reviewed against the supplied card-grid reference.

## Services artwork blend follow-up

- Matched the homepage feature-card image treatment: darker feature-card surface, `lighten` compositing, full opacity, and the shared saturation/contrast values.
- Added a tighter radial edge fade for the restored square artwork so the older image canvases dissolve into the service cards while remaining readable in the lower-right.
- Kept the artwork lower-right and readable while giving each full-width card its own uninterrupted surface.

## Contact TopNet page review

final result: passed

- Source visual truth: `https://deisgne8.github.io/topnet-wireframe/?page=contact`.
- Implementation: `contact.html`, rendered at `http://127.0.0.1:4173/contact.html` in the Codex in-app browser.
- Viewport/state: desktop browser viewport at 1280 × 720 px; page at the top of the contact route and scrolled through the story, strengths, enquiry, Saudi presence, final CTA, and footer states.
- Source and implementation evidence: the supplied wireframe was opened and reviewed in the browser, then the local implementation was captured at the same desktop viewport. The browser-control surface exposed the capture in-session rather than as a persistent image file.
- Full-view comparison: the contact hero uses the wireframe’s label, headline, and supporting copy with the existing TOPNET typography, navy canvas, violet/lime asset treatment, and shared header. The page then adds the requested approved company story and key-strength sections before the wireframe enquiry content, followed by Saudi presence, final CTA, and footer.
- Focused comparisons: the enquiry form and three contact-route cards were reviewed against the wireframe copy; the Saudi presence block and footer were reviewed for layout, city labels, and missing-asset flags.
- Fidelity surfaces checked: Manrope typography and weights; spacing and section rhythm; navy/violet/lime tokens, borders, and rounded controls; supplied molecule and strength icon assets; wireframe copy and project-approved strength copy.
- Interaction checks: services menu expands/collapses; service-category links remain routed to `services.html`; the area-of-interest selector opens and selects all eight service categories; contact and careers links resolve to real project pages; the form remains a prototype-safe no-submit interaction.
- Content flags: the supplied wireframe’s prototype contact routes remain visible; production support URL, social/legal destinations, and map artwork are explicitly flagged as not supplied. Careers now links to the available `careers.html` page.
- Responsive implementation: page-scoped rules cover the 1000 px and 700 px breakpoints, stacking the story, strength grid, enquiry routes, presence block, CTA, and footer without changing homepage rules. A separate narrow-browser capture was not available in this run; this remains a follow-up verification gap rather than a reported visual defect.
- No actionable P0/P1/P2 findings remain from the desktop comparison. Remaining P3: capture a dedicated narrow viewport once the browser viewport control is available.

## Contact wireframe scope follow-up

final result: passed

- Reduced `contact.html` to the supplied wireframe sections only: Contact hero, Enterprise Enquiry with the three contact routes, Saudi presence, and the shared footer.
- Removed the non-wireframe company story, key strengths, final CTA, and implementation-only contact note.
- Matched the Contact banner to the existing About Us banner treatment while retaining the wireframe Contact copy.
- Rechecked the rendered page in the browser: the accessibility tree contains only the wireframe page sections, with the map still clearly marked as a placeholder because no approved map asset was supplied.

## Services artwork follow-up

- Restored the existing approved homepage card artwork for the eight service cards, using the closest available visual match for each category.

## Careers page review

final result: passed

- Source visual truth: `https://deisgne8.github.io/topnet-wireframe/?page=careers`.
- Implementation: `careers.html`, rendered in the Codex in-app browser at `http://127.0.0.1:4173/careers.html`.
- Viewport/state: desktop browser viewport at 1280 × 720 px; reviewed at the hero, company story, Saudi presence, strengths, open positions, CTA, and footer states.
- Source and implementation evidence: the supplied wireframe was captured in the browser at the same desktop viewport, then the local Careers page was rendered and reviewed in-session. No persistent screenshot file was available from the browser-control surface.
- Full-view comparison: the Careers hero retains the wireframe’s label, headline, supporting copy, dark TOPNET canvas, Manrope typography, and shared header/footer treatment. The requested company story, Saudi presence, key strengths, and contact CTA are added with existing approved project copy and assets.
- Focused comparisons: the four Why Work cards and two open-position cards were reviewed against the wireframe copy, including the disabled “Opening soon” state and role filters.
- Fidelity surfaces checked: typography, spacing/layout rhythm, navy/violet/lime tokens, supplied molecule/cloud/strength assets, and wireframe copy/content.
- Interaction checks: shared Services menu expands and switches categories; team/location filters update the visible role list and show an empty state; Careers and Contact links resolve to real local pages; the available role routes to the real Contact page because no detailed job page was supplied.
- Responsive implementation: page-scoped rules cover desktop, tablet, and mobile breakpoints, stacking the story/presence layouts and values/strengths/filter grids; a dedicated narrow-browser screenshot was not available from the current browser-control surface.
- Content flags: detailed role descriptions, application destinations, and a recruitment inbox were not supplied in the approved project content and are called out on the page instead of being invented.
- Removed the temporary generated service-card image set from the project.

## Careers wireframe scope follow-up

final result: passed

- Reduced `careers.html` to the wireframe sections only: Careers hero, Why Work at TopNet, Open Positions, and the shared footer.
- Removed the non-wireframe company story, Saudi presence, key strengths, contact CTA, hero CTA, and extra content note.
- Rechecked the rendered page in the browser: the four Why Work cards and two Open Positions cards remain, and no removed sections are present in the accessibility tree.

## Careers continuous background follow-up

final result: passed

- Removed the visual section break by keeping the Careers hero, Why Work, and Open Positions surfaces transparent over one shared page background.
- Tightened the vertical transition between the Why Work cards and Open Positions so the content reads as one continuous page.
- Verified the result in the browser at the Careers hero and Open Positions states; card borders remain the only section-level framing.

## Careers TopNet card and icon style follow-up

final result: passed

- Source visual truth: the supplied TopNet four-card reference screenshot.
- Matched the Why Work cards to the reference with 16px corners, thin slate borders, restrained navy gradient surfaces, 264px desktop card height, and the existing responsive grid.
- Matched the icon treatment with 52px black circular shells, 24px white approved asset icons, and the reference title/body spacing.
- Verified the rendered card state in the browser at the local Careers route; no new artwork or invented icon assets were introduced.

## Careers dropdown style follow-up

final result: passed

- Source visual truth: the supplied open Team dropdown screenshot.
- Matched the filter labels, 55px field height, dark navy select surface, slate border, lime focus border/glow, and native option colors to the TopNet reference.
- Verified the focused Team dropdown state in the local browser while preserving the existing functional team and location filters.

## Careers footer blend follow-up

final result: passed

- Source visual truth: the supplied blended footer screenshot.
- Changed the Careers page canvas to fade into the shared footer atmosphere instead of ending at a hard slate boundary.
- Preserved the existing footer panel, artwork treatment, newsletter control, legal row, and real local navigation links.
- Verified the footer transition in the local browser at the Careers footer state.

## Careers green icon follow-up

final result: passed

- Restored the approved TopNet green source artwork for the four Why Work icons instead of applying a white inversion.
- Kept the black circular icon shells and card treatment from the supplied reference unchanged.
- Verified the rendered green icon state in the local Careers browser preview.

## Careers TopNet dropdown follow-up

final result: passed

- Replaced the browser-native career filters with accessible custom TopNet dropdowns so the open menu can match the supplied reference consistently.
- Matched the open-state option treatment: light-blue selected row, slate unselected rows, compact 27px row height, and dark field with lime focus styling.
- Verified the Team menu opens, exposes its options in the accessibility tree, closes on selection, and filters the visible role list.

## About molecule orbit follow-up

- Centered the molecule to the orbit system and restored the fourth, innermost orbit ring to match the reference composition.
- Corrected the later desktop artwork override so the active molecule position uses the same center axis as the orbit rings.
- Updated the narrow viewport rule to center the molecule from the viewport midpoint rather than anchoring it from the right edge.

## Section background blend follow-up

- Removed the opaque Why TopNet section fill and replaced it with a soft fading wash so the surrounding page gradient continues through the section without a hard horizontal seam.

## Lower service icon alignment follow-up

- Raised both lower infrastructure service icons to sit on top of their connector lines, matching the upper icon treatment.

## Cloud data-line follow-up

- Shifted the three animated vertical data lines slightly to the right while preserving their lengths, glow, and animation timing.

## Footer logo visibility follow-up

- Raised the footer brand above the decorative background layers and applied the same cream logo treatment as the reference so the TopNet mark remains visible inside the card.

## Rayadah capability card hierarchy follow-up

final result: blocked

- Source visual truth: user-supplied Rayadah Cloud service-card screenshot.
- Updated `rayadah-cloud.html` so each capability card starts with a full-opacity icon, followed by the title and description.
- Removed the service-card number and moved the `CLOUD CAPABILITY` label into a bottom-aligned footer treatment on every card.
- Preserved the approved Storage Services option chips and the existing shared TOPNET typography, colors, and assets.
- Static checks passed: six capability cards and six footer tags are present; card numbers are absent from the capability-card markup; HTML/CSS brace counts are balanced; `git diff --check` passes; `index.html` is unchanged.
- Final rendered screenshot comparison remains unavailable because the local `file://` page could not be refreshed through the browser tool's URL policy.

## Rayadah Cloud Journey spacing and eyebrow follow-up

final result: blocked

- Set the editorial journey to exact 100px desktop left/right spacing and removed the narrower max-width constraint.
- Rebalanced the ambient journey image to a larger, lower-left position with stronger visibility while retaining its hover-driven image switching.
- Changed the eyebrow from the bracket treatment to the shared rounded TopNet pill style.
- Static checks passed: HTML parsing succeeds, 100px gutter rules are present, the TopNet pill treatment is present, image sizing rules are present, CSS braces are balanced, and `git diff --check` passes.
- Final rendered screenshot comparison remains unavailable because the local `file://` page could not be refreshed through the browser tool's URL policy.

## Rayadah Cloud Journey editorial layout follow-up

final result: blocked

- Reworked YOUR CLOUD JOURNEY into a two-column editorial layout inspired by the supplied reference: TopNet-styled section label and heading on the left, lead copy and all four numbered journey titles with descriptions on the right.
- Retained the approved journey artwork as a subtle ambient preview that changes on title hover, click, and keyboard selection.
- Preserved Rayadah dark navy, blue, lime, and light editorial text treatment with responsive stacking for smaller screens.
- Static checks passed: HTML parsing succeeds, four journey titles and four preview images remain wired, JavaScript state updates are present, CSS braces are balanced, and `git diff --check` passes.
- Final rendered screenshot comparison remains unavailable because the local `file://` page could not be refreshed through the browser tool's URL policy.

## Rayadah Cloud Journey hover-title follow-up

final result: blocked

- Removed the large step number from each Cloud Journey feature panel.
- Kept all four titles visible in the journey tab strip and made hover change the active image, while retaining click and keyboard selection.
- Static checks passed: HTML parsing succeeds, four journey tabs remain present, hover switching is wired, CSS braces are balanced, and `git diff --check` passes.
- Final rendered screenshot comparison remains unavailable because the local `file://` page could not be refreshed through the browser tool's URL policy.

## Rayadah operating model center connector follow-up

final result: blocked

- Corrected the ONE CLOUD OPERATING MODEL grid from four tracks to three tracks so the connector arcs align with all three actual cards, including the center card.
- Preserved the flipped connector treatment, animation, 100px desktop gutters, and responsive two-column/one-column fallbacks.
- Static checks passed: HTML parsing succeeds, three model cards match the three-column grid, connector rules remain present, CSS braces are balanced, and `git diff --check` passes.
- Final rendered screenshot comparison remains unavailable because the local `file://` page could not be refreshed through the browser tool's URL policy.

## Rayadah Cloud Journey gutter follow-up

final result: blocked

- Set the desktop Cloud Journey section to an exact 100px left and right gutter and removed the narrower centered stage width so the feature card fills the intended content area.
- Preserved the tab controls, feature-card layout, blue image treatment, and responsive tablet/mobile behavior.
- Static checks passed: HTML parsing succeeds, 100px gutter rules are present, CSS braces are balanced, and `git diff --check` passes.
- Final rendered screenshot comparison remains unavailable because the local `file://` page could not be refreshed through the browser tool's URL policy.

## Rayadah estimate header swap follow-up

final result: blocked

- Swapped the ESTIMATED PRICE card header into a horizontal row with the Monthly/Annual toggle on the left and ESTIMATED PRICE on the right, matching the supplied reference.
- Preserved the existing billing controls, output hooks, calculator behavior, and mobile stacked fallback.
- Static checks passed: HTML parsing succeeds, the estimate header is in place, JavaScript billing hooks remain present, CSS braces are balanced, and `git diff --check` passes.
- Final rendered screenshot comparison remains unavailable because the local `file://` page could not be refreshed through the browser tool's URL policy.

## Rayadah section title rhythm follow-up

final result: blocked

- Standardized the five Rayadah section headings to balanced two-line desktop breaks and widened the heading rhythm so the model and capabilities CTAs stay at the right edge of their heading rows.
- Disabled forced breaks at mobile widths so headings return to natural responsive wrapping.
- Static checks passed: HTML parsing succeeds, all five title-break markers are present, CTA alignment rules remain present, CSS braces are balanced, and `git diff --check` passes.
- Final rendered screenshot comparison remains unavailable because the local `file://` page could not be refreshed through the browser tool's URL policy.

## Internet Connectivity page review

final result: passed

### Source visual truth

- Wireframe: `https://deisgne8.github.io/topnet-wireframe/?page=services/internet-connectivity`
- Source capture: Chrome browser capture at 1918 × 792 CSS px, device density 1, desktop hero and lower-section states reviewed.

### Implementation evidence

- Implementation: `http://127.0.0.1:4173/internet-connectivity.html`
- Browser-rendered capture: Chrome tab `1595205806` at 1918 × 792 CSS px, device density 1. The browser capture was reviewed directly; the CUA browser surface does not expose a standalone screenshot file path.
- Primary interactions tested: FAQ accordion, enquiry service selector, sticky section navigation targets, and services menu hover/open state.
- Console errors: no runtime error surfaced during browser rendering or interaction checks.

### Comparison

- Full view: hero composition follows the wireframe hierarchy while carrying the existing TOPNET dark navy, lime, purple, typography, button, header, and footer system from `index.html`.
- Focused regions: hero service model, outcomes cards, capability grid, delivery steps, FAQ accordion, related services, enquiry form, and footer were visually reviewed at the same desktop viewport.
- Typography, spacing, color tokens, existing assets, and wireframe copy were checked. The service model uses accessible HTML/CSS geometry because no approved raster asset for that diagram exists in the project.

### Findings

- No actionable P0, P1, or P2 differences were found for the requested desktop implementation.
- The two collapsed FAQ answers were not supplied by the wireframe copy, so the page exposes a transparent “Answer not supplied in the approved wireframe copy.” state instead of inventing facts.
- Related Data Connectivity, SD-WAN Connectivity, and VPN Connectivity detail pages are not present in the project; their links return to the existing Connectivity Services directory.

### Responsive and implementation checklist

- New standalone `internet-connectivity.html` page uses `styles.css` and `script.js`.
- Existing homepage layout remains outside the new page-scoped styles.
- Responsive CSS covers the 1000px, 700px, and 600px breakpoints, including stacked hero, cards, facts, delivery steps, FAQ, CTA, and footer behavior.
- `services.html` now links its Internet Connectivity capability to the new page.
- Static HTML parsing and `git diff --check` pass.
